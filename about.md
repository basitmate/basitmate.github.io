I am a Front-End focused developer from Karachi, Pakistan. I have developed my skills from the very basic HTML, CSS and JS to Creating Web Applications and Robust Email Designs which do not break (IE excused).

I have worked on quite a few front-end tasks from creating Robust Modern Email Templates to Web Applications and Browser Animation. I have also helped the web development community by contributing to the design and code.

You can contact me by emailing me: [basit@frontenddesigner.com](mailto:basitmate@live.com) or by giving me a mention on twitter: [@basitmate](https://twitter.com/basitmate)
